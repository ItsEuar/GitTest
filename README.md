###Webpage
----

I used  <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Programming language">JS</abbr> to make it.
Also, I used the Git Bash to save all the versions and changes of the webpage.
Finally, I used GitHub to upload my progress.

###Comments

> I loved the course because I learned too much about many GitHub tools and its use in the real world. Also, I learned how to solve potential problems with Git commands.

###Functions

The webpage have only 1 function that show you a simple message.
You can modify the message and its style if you edit the JS archive.

####Javascript

```javascript
	const newP = document.createElement("p");
    newP.className = "YourStyle"
    newP.innerHTML = "Your message";
    div1.appendChild(newP);
```

####End :)
